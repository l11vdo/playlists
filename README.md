# My Playlists

## A bare bones reactJS implementation of a spotify playlist manager

## INTRODUCTION

A coding challenge set by 'adserve' as part of their recruitment process.

### INSTALLATION / USAGE

Update CLIENT-ID in src/actions/constants.js

The app is rooted in 'http://localhost:3000/callback' due to whitelist restrictions with the spotofy API

The emphasis has been to implement the mechanics of creating / updating spoticy playlists.

Extensive use of redux for state management.

Implemented oAuth security using the authToken provided by Spotify

Use of ES6/7 object oriented coding patterns in the main

This is still 'work in progress' so code is not yet production standard

All dependencies in package.json

### FUNCTIONALITY RESTRICTIONS

- No particular effort styling as yet - all pages are 'wireframe'
- Playlist Delete - not obviously supported by spotify api.
- New release selection - limited to 'singles' to keep it simpler
- Use of 'alert's for validation / notification messages
